# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

## Dataset

The datasets contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by european cardholders. 
This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. 
The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.  

In this kernel we will use various predictive models to see how accurate they are in detecting whether a transaction is a normal payment or a fraud. 
As described in the dataset, the features are scaled and the names of the features are not shown due to privacy reasons. 
Nevertheless, we can still analyze some important aspects of the dataset. Let's start!
